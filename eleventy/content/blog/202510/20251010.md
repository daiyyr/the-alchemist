Just had this dream.

In the dream I was watching a movie in English.

In the movie a girl with Ruth's face was packing her stuff in a room. A boy was in the same room.

With tear in her eyes, the girl said: "Nobody's trouble is unique. Everyone can wait to solve their problem tomorrow." I thought she meant that their love was not special and that the pain would heal eventually.

The boy: silent.

The girl: I know you would try to contact me. Now listen, if I want you to never contact me again, I will leave behind the harmonica you gave me.

The boy: silent.

A few days later, the boy visited a friend and found the harmonica.

I thought I wanted to watch that movie again and then found it's a dream.
